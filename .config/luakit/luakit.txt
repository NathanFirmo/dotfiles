:viewsource (views the source)
:viewsource! (goes back to webpage)

***************************************************
Quickmarks: Let's you assign a webpage to a specified key. Type M followed by key you wish to assign the page to. To open that page at a later time, type go[assigned-key] to open in current tab, or gn[assigned-key] to open in a new tab.

***************************************************
Pressing f highlights all the links on the page and assigns them a number. At bottom of page, type the corresponding number after Follow: to go to it.

***************************************************
Adblock for luakit:

Use https://gist.github.com/1073680 and put it in your ~/.config/luakit. Name it adblock.lua 

Edit your rc.lua and include:
       ******
require "adblock"
       ******

Then create a file ~/.config/luakit/adblock.blacklist according to the comment in the adblock.lua. Here's what works for facebook for example:
facebook%.com

Here's a script which translates hosts files for adblocking into an adblock.blacklist file. Use it as an example only!

How to change useragent:
globals.useragent = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chromium/14.0.825.0"

If you append ?nobrowsercheck=true to the end of the gmail.com url (or any other url that rejects unknown browsers?) it will let you access it with the normal luakit user agent.

***************************************************
How to group bookmarks:
Type "B" and then after the link add a word, e.g.
:bookmark https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=983863 Archlinux
:bookmark https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125310 Archlinux

**************************************************
To use ctrl-c to copy to clipboard, go to insert mode first (press i)
You can then use ctrl-v to paste.

**************************************************
How to set luakit to save the current session every time instead of only by ZZ, even if it's closed by the window manager:

In your rc.lua, place a session.save() at the top of the window.methods.close_win function:

               ********

local close_win = window.methods.close_win
window.methods.close_win = function (w, ...)
    session.save{w}
    close_win(w, ...)
end

              ********

Another option offered:
Edit window.lua (should be in ~/.config/luakit, or you should copy it to there from the xdg folder).
On line 658 you'll find a function called "navigate".  Add a line just before the closing "end" which is on line 671.  The line should save the current session by calling w:save_session().

               ********

    navigate = function (w, uri, view)
        view = view or w.view
        if view then
            local js = string.match(uri, "^javascript:(.+)$")
            if js then
                --return view:eval_js(luakit.uri_decode(js), "(javascript-uri)")
                return view:eval_js(luakit.uri_decode(js),
                    "(luakit::navigate)", true)
            end
            view.uri = uri
        else
            return w:new_tab(uri)
        end
        w:save_session()  -- THIS LINE WAS ADDED
    end,

              **********

*************************************************
To use userconf.lua to remap binds, 
paste the binding aliases there:
-- Binding aliases
local key, buf, but = lousy.bind.key, lousy.bind.buf, lousy.bind.but
then add binds within the brackets:
------------------ binds.lua 
add_binds("normal", {
--for example
   -- History
    key({},          "b",           function (w, m) w:back(m.count)    end),
    key({},          "n",           function (w, m) w:forward(m.count) end),
}, true)

**************************************************
To disable/enable javascript, scripts, and plugins:

Add this to your rc.lua somewhere between the 'require "webview"' line (make sure it is after "binds" as well) and the "end user script loading" 

     *****
require "noscript"
noscript.enable_scripts = false
noscript.enable_plugins = false
     *****

Then use:
,ts to toggle scripts such as javascript and others for the current domain.
,tp to toggle plugins such as Flash for the current domain.
,tr to remove NoScript rules for a given domain.

Note the , must be typed as well.
